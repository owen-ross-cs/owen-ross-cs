### From the moment I started programming in high school, I was fascinated by how the apps, websites, and games I used every day actually worked. That curiosity led me to pursue software development, where I built web and mobile applications using languages like Java, JavaScript, C#, Kotlin, and Swift. Writing code gave me a way to solve problems creatively and bring ideas to life.

### As my skills grew, so did my interest in what happens behind the scenes. I was interested in how systems are protected, where they are vulnerable, and what can happen if security is overlooked. That curiosity evolved into a passion for cyber security, which I now study in the final year of my program at Sheridan College.

### Through my coursework and hands-on labs, I’ve explored network defense, penetration testing, digital forensics, and threat analysis. I enjoy digging into complex problems, whether it’s tracing anomalies in network traffic, investigating security incidents, or analyzing how attackers exploit weaknesses. My background in development gives me a unique perspective: I understand how applications are built, which helps me see where they can—and should—be secured.

### At the core, what drives me is the same curiosity that started years ago: the desire to understand systems deeply and use that knowledge to protect them. My goal is to build a career where I can combine my love for programming with my passion for cyber security to help organizations stay resilient in an ever-changing threat landscape.
